What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?	The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is Machine Learning (ML)?	A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is deep learning?	A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is a neural network?	A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information in layers.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is computer vision?	A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and process visual information from the world, such as images and videos.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?	A branch of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is a model in AI/ML?	A mathematical representation or program that is trained to recognize patterns or make predictions based on data.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is an algorithm in the context of AI/ML?	A set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to solve a problem or perform a task, such as training a model.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is training in machine learning?	The process of teaching a model to recognize patterns by exposing it to data and adjusting its parameters to minimize errors.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is inferencing in machine learning?	The process of using a trained model to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is bias in AI/ML?	A systematic error in a model that leads to unfair or inaccurate outcomes, often due to prejudiced training data or flawed assumptions.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is fairness in AI/ML?	The principle of ensuring that AI/ML systems make decisions impartially and do not discriminate against individuals or groups.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What does 'fit' mean in machine learning?	The degree to which a model accurately represents the relationship between input data and output predictions.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?	A type of AI model, often based on deep learning, trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
How does AI differ from ML?	AI is a broader concept of machines simulating human intelligence, while ML is a subset of AI focused on learning from data.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
How does deep learning differ from traditional ML?	Deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to automatically extract features from data, while traditional ML often requires manual feature engineering.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is batch inferencing?	A method where predictions are made on a large set of data at once, typically in non-real-time scenarios.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is real-time inferencing?	A method where predictions are made instantly as new data arrives, enabling immediate responses.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is labeled data?	Data that has been tagged with the correct answer or output, used for supervised learning.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?	Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning trains models through trial and error using rewards and penalties.	Domain 1 - Task 1.1
