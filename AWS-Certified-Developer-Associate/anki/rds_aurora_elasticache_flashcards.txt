Which of the following database engines is NOT supported by Amazon RDS?<br>A) MySQL<br>B) PostgreSQL<br>C) MongoDB<br>D) Oracle	<b>C) MongoDB</b><br>Amazon RDS supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora. MongoDB is a NoSQL database not supported by RDS.

What is the key difference between Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora?<br>A) RDS only supports MySQL while Aurora supports multiple engines<br>B) Aurora is cloud-native and offers better performance and availability than RDS<br>C) RDS is serverless while Aurora requires instance management<br>D) Aurora only works in a single AZ while RDS supports Multi-AZ	<b>B) Aurora is cloud-native and offers better performance and availability than RDS</b><br>Aurora is AWS's cloud-native database offering up to 5x performance improvement over MySQL and 3x over PostgreSQL, with better availability features.

Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide:<br>A) Read scaling across multiple Availability Zones<br>B) Automatic failover to a standby instance in another AZ<br>C) Load balancing between multiple database instances<br>D) Automatic data partitioning across AZs	<b>B) Automatic failover to a standby instance in another AZ</b><br>Multi-AZ provides high availability with automatic failover to a standby replica in another AZ during planned maintenance or unplanned outages.

What are the two caching engines offered by Amazon ElastiCache?<br>A) MySQL and PostgreSQL<br>B) Redis and Memcached<br>C) DynamoDB and DocumentDB<br>D) Aurora and RDS	<b>B) Redis and Memcached</b><br>ElastiCache supports two popular open-source in-memory caching engines: Redis and Memcached, each with different features and use cases.

Which ElastiCache engine supports data persistence and complex data structures?<br>A) Memcached supports both features<br>B) Redis supports both features<br>C) Neither engine supports these features<br>D) Both engines support these features equally	<b>B) Redis supports both features</b><br>Redis supports data persistence (snapshots and AOF), complex data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes), and advanced features like pub/sub and transactions. Memcached is simpler and doesn't support persistence.

Amazon Aurora automatically backs up your database and retains backups for how long by default?<br>A) 1 day<br>B) 7 days<br>C) 30 days<br>D) 35 days	<b>B) 7 days</b><br>Aurora automatically backs up your database with a default retention period of 7 days, which can be extended up to 35 days. Backups are continuous and incremental.

What is the primary benefit of Amazon RDS Read Replicas?<br>A) Automatic failover during database outages<br>B) Scaling read workloads and reducing load on the primary database<br>C) Encrypting data at rest and in transit<br>D) Automating database schema migrations	<b>B) Scaling read workloads and reducing load on the primary database</b><br>Read Replicas allow you to create read-only copies of your database to scale read operations and reduce the load on your primary database instance.

Which AWS service provides the best solution for caching database query results to improve application performance?<br>A) Amazon RDS<br>B) Amazon Aurora<br>C) Amazon ElastiCache<br>D) Amazon DynamoDB	<b>C) Amazon ElastiCache</b><br>ElastiCache is specifically designed for caching frequently accessed data in memory, providing microsecond latency for read operations and significantly improving application performance.

Amazon Aurora Serverless is best suited for:<br>A) High-traffic production applications requiring consistent performance<br>B) Applications with unpredictable or intermittent workloads<br>C) Applications requiring complex database administration<br>D) Applications that need on-premises database connectivity	<b>B) Applications with unpredictable or intermittent workloads</b><br>Aurora Serverless automatically scales compute capacity based on application demand, making it ideal for intermittent, unpredictable workloads, or applications used infrequently.

What happens to your Amazon RDS instance during a maintenance window?<br>A) The instance continues running without any impact<br>B) The instance may experience a brief outage for single-AZ deployments<br>C) All data is automatically backed up to S3<br>D) The instance is permanently shut down	<b>B) The instance may experience a brief outage for single-AZ deployments</b><br>During maintenance windows, single-AZ deployments may experience brief outages while Multi-AZ deployments typically fail over to the standby instance to minimize downtime.
