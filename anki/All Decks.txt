What is an Amazon VPC?	A logically-isolated virtual network in the AWS Cloud that you configure with your own CIDR block, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
Which resource lets instances reach the wider internet?	An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** attached to the VPC and referenced in a subnet’s route table.
What is the allowed CIDR range for a VPC?	You can choose any /16 to /28 block (65 536 – 16 IPs).
How many Availability Zones can a single subnet span?	Exactly **one**; a subnet is always confined to a single AZ.
Why can subnets in the same VPC route to each other automatically?	Every VPC’s main route table includes an implicit “local” route for the entire CIDR.
Security Group vs. Network ACL in one sentence?	SGs are **stateful** and attach to ENIs; NACLs are **stateless** and apply to subnets.<br><div>**NACL stands for <b>Network Access Control List</b> — an optional, subnet-level firewall in an Amazon VPC that lets you allow <b>or</b> deny specific inbound and outbound traffic.</div>
Default limit: how many security groups per ENI?	**5** (soft limit; can be raised).
What limitation exists with VPC peering?	No **transitive routing** — you must peer each VPC pair directly.
Which Route 53 record type maps a root domain to an ALB or S3 site?	An **Alias A/AAAA** record.
List the four components that come with a default VPC.	One VPC, a public subnet in every AZ, an Internet Gateway, and a main route table with 0.0.0.0/0 to the IGW.
What subnet-level feature filters traffic, separate from SGs?	**Network ACLs** with ordered, stateless rules.
What built-in DNS resolver exists at the .2 address?	**AmazonProvidedDNS** (Route 53 Resolver in each subnet).
How do you privately access S3 without using the internet?	Create a **Gateway VPC endpoint** for S3 and update route tables.
When would you use a NAT Gateway instead of an IGW?	For private-subnet instances that need outbound internet access without exposing inbound ports.
Where do you place an Application Load Balancer?	In **public subnets**; its targets can live in private or public subnets.
