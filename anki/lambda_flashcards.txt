What is the maximum size limit for a Lambda deployment package when uploaded directly?<br>A) 10 MB<br>B) 50 MB<br>C) 100 MB<br>D) 250 MB	<b>B) 50 MB</b><br>The maximum deployment package size is 50 MB when uploaded directly (zipped). For larger packages, you must upload to S3 (up to 250 MB unzipped).

Which Lambda feature allows you to manage different versions of your function code?<br>A) Lambda Layers<br>B) Lambda Aliases<br>C) Lambda Versions and Aliases<br>D) Lambda Environment Variables	<b>C) Lambda Versions and Aliases</b><br>Lambda Versions create immutable snapshots of your function code, and Aliases provide mutable pointers to specific versions, enabling traffic splitting and blue/green deployments.

What is the default concurrent execution limit for AWS Lambda functions per region?<br>A) 100<br>B) 500<br>C) 1,000<br>D) 10,000	<b>C) 1,000</b><br>The default concurrent execution limit is 1,000 executions per region, though this can be increased by requesting a limit increase from AWS Support.

Which environment variable automatically provides the name of the Lambda function?<br>A) LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME<br>B) AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME<br>C) FUNCTION_NAME<br>D) AWS_FUNCTION_NAME	<b>B) AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME</b><br>AWS automatically sets the AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME environment variable with the name of the Lambda function being executed.

What is the purpose of a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in Lambda?<br>A) To store function logs for debugging<br>B) To cache frequently used data<br>C) To capture failed function invocations for analysis<br>D) To queue incoming requests during high traffic	<b>C) To capture failed function invocations for analysis</b><br>A Dead Letter Queue captures events that fail to be processed after the maximum retry attempts, allowing for error analysis and reprocessing.

Which AWS service provides the BEST way to monitor Lambda function performance and errors?<br>A) AWS Config<br>B) AWS CloudTrail<br>C) AWS CloudWatch<br>D) AWS X-Ray	<b>C) AWS CloudWatch</b><br>CloudWatch automatically collects Lambda metrics (duration, errors, throttles), logs, and enables custom metrics. X-Ray provides distributed tracing but CloudWatch is the primary monitoring service.

What happens when a Lambda function is invoked synchronously and returns an error?<br>A) The error is automatically retried 3 times<br>B) The error is sent to a Dead Letter Queue<br>C) The error is returned immediately to the caller<br>D) The function is automatically redeployed	<b>C) The error is returned immediately to the caller</b><br>For synchronous invocations, errors are returned directly to the caller. It's the caller's responsibility to handle retries. Automatic retries only occur for asynchronous invocations.

When should you use provisioned concurrency for Lambda functions?<br>A) To reduce costs for infrequently used functions<br>B) To eliminate cold starts for latency-sensitive applications<br>C) To increase the maximum execution timeout<br>D) To enable cross-region replication	<b>B) To eliminate cold starts for latency-sensitive applications</b><br>Provisioned concurrency keeps Lambda functions warm and ready to respond immediately, eliminating cold start latency for time-sensitive applications.

Which IAM component determines what AWS services a Lambda function can access?<br>A) Lambda Resource Policy<br>B) Lambda Execution Role<br>C) Lambda Function Policy<br>D) Lambda Security Group	<b>B) Lambda Execution Role</b><br>The Lambda execution role is an IAM role that grants the function permissions to access AWS services and resources during execution.

What is Lambda@Edge primarily used for?<br>A) Running Lambda functions in multiple AWS regions simultaneously<br>B) Executing Lambda functions at CloudFront edge locations<br>C) Connecting Lambda functions to on-premises networks<br>D) Scaling Lambda functions beyond normal concurrency limits	<b>B) Executing Lambda functions at CloudFront edge locations</b><br>Lambda@Edge allows you to run Lambda functions at CloudFront edge locations, enabling custom logic closer to users for improved performance.

Which event source can trigger a Lambda function to process records from a stream?<br>A) Amazon S3<br>B) Amazon API Gateway<br>C) Amazon Kinesis<br>D) Amazon Route 53	<b>C) Amazon Kinesis</b><br>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams can trigger Lambda functions to process streaming data records. Lambda polls the stream and invokes the function with batches of records.

What is the recommended approach for managing sensitive data like API keys in Lambda functions?<br>A) Hardcode them in the function code<br>B) Store them in environment variables<br>C) Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager<br>D) Include them in the deployment package	<b>C) Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager</b><br>Best practice is to store sensitive data in Parameter Store or Secrets Manager and retrieve it at runtime, rather than using environment variables which are visible in the console.
