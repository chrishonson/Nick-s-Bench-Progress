What is the primary purpose of AWS X-Ray?<br>A) To monitor server hardware metrics<br>B) To provide distributed tracing and analysis of applications<br>C) To store application logs<br>D) To scale applications automatically	<b>B) To provide distributed tracing and analysis of applications</b><br>X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications by providing end-to-end tracing of requests across multiple services and identifying bottlenecks.

What are CloudWatch Metrics?<br>A) Log files generated by applications<br>B) Time-ordered data points that measure the performance of AWS services and applications<br>C) Configuration files for AWS resources<br>D) Security policies for resource access	<b>B) Time-ordered data points that measure the performance of AWS services and applications</b><br>CloudWatch Metrics are time-series data that provide insights into the performance and health of AWS resources and applications.

What is a CloudWatch Alarm?<br>A) A notification that AWS services are down<br>B) A monitoring rule that triggers actions when a metric crosses a specified threshold<br>C) An error message in application logs<br>D) A security alert for unauthorized access	<b>B) A monitoring rule that triggers actions when a metric crosses a specified threshold</b><br>CloudWatch Alarms monitor metrics and can trigger actions like SNS notifications, Auto Scaling, or EC2 actions when thresholds are breached.

What information does an X-Ray trace provide?<br>A) Only error messages from the application<br>B) A detailed map of request flow through services with timing and error information<br>C) Server configuration details<br>D) Database schema information	<b>B) A detailed map of request flow through services with timing and error information</b><br>X-Ray traces show the complete path of requests through your application, including service calls, response times, and errors at each step.

What are CloudWatch Custom Metrics?<br>A) Metrics automatically generated by AWS services<br>B) Application-specific metrics that you publish to CloudWatch using the API or CLI<br>C) Metrics from third-party monitoring tools<br>D) Historical data from previous months	<b>B) Application-specific metrics that you publish to CloudWatch using the API or CLI</b><br>Custom Metrics allow you to publish application-specific data points to CloudWatch using the PutMetricData API, enabling monitoring of business metrics.

What is the default retention period for CloudWatch Logs?<br>A) 7 days<br>B) 30 days<br>C) Never expires (indefinite)<br>D) 1 year	<b>C) Never expires (indefinite)</b><br>CloudWatch Logs are stored indefinitely by default, but you can set retention periods from 1 day to 10 years to manage costs and compliance requirements.

Which X-Ray component must be installed on EC2 instances to send trace data?<br>A) X-Ray SDK only<br>B) X-Ray Daemon only<br>C) Both X-Ray SDK and X-Ray Daemon<br>D) CloudWatch Agent	<b>C) Both X-Ray SDK and X-Ray Daemon</b><br>The X-Ray SDK instruments your application code to generate trace data, while the X-Ray Daemon collects and sends the trace data to the X-Ray service.

What is CloudWatch Logs Insights?<br>A) A real-time log streaming service<br>B) A query and analysis service for CloudWatch Logs using a SQL-like syntax<br>C) A log compression service<br>D) A log backup service	<b>B) A query and analysis service for CloudWatch Logs using a SQL-like syntax</b><br>CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to interactively search and analyze log data using a query language, making it easy to identify patterns and troubleshoot issues.

What is the difference between CloudWatch detailed monitoring and basic monitoring for EC2?<br>A) Detailed monitoring provides more metric types<br>B) Detailed monitoring provides 1-minute intervals, basic monitoring provides 5-minute intervals<br>C) Detailed monitoring includes X-Ray tracing<br>D) Basic monitoring is more expensive	<b>B) Detailed monitoring provides 1-minute intervals, basic monitoring provides 5-minute intervals</b><br>Basic monitoring provides metrics at 5-minute intervals for free, while detailed monitoring provides metrics at 1-minute intervals for additional cost.

Which AWS service automatically integrates with X-Ray for distributed tracing?<br>A) EC2<br>B) Lambda<br>C) S3<br>D) RDS	<b>B) Lambda</b><br>AWS Lambda has built-in integration with X-Ray - you can enable tracing with a simple configuration change, and Lambda automatically captures traces for function executions and downstream service calls.
