Which S3 security feature allows you to define who can access your bucket and what actions they can perform?<br>A) S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs)<br>B) S3 Bucket Policies<br>C) S3 User Policies<br>D) Both A and B	<b>D) Both A and B</b><br>Both S3 Bucket Policies (JSON-based) and Access Control Lists (ACLs) can control access to S3 buckets and objects, though bucket policies are more flexible and recommended.

What is the purpose of S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?<br>A) To improve read performance by caching objects<br>B) To automatically replicate objects to a bucket in a different AWS region<br>C) To compress objects to save storage costs<br>D) To encrypt objects during transmission	<b>B) To automatically replicate objects to a bucket in a different AWS region</b><br>S3 Cross-Region Replication automatically replicates objects from a source bucket to a destination bucket in a different AWS region for compliance, disaster recovery, or latency reduction.

Which encryption option encrypts S3 objects using keys managed entirely by AWS?<br>A) SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys)<br>B) SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS)<br>C) SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys)<br>D) Client-Side Encryption	<b>C) SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys)</b><br>SSE-S3 uses encryption keys that are fully managed by Amazon S3, requiring no key management from the customer. AWS handles all encryption and decryption operations.

What is the maximum object size that can be uploaded to S3 in a single PUT operation?<br>A) 1 GB<br>B) 5 GB<br>C) 10 GB<br>D) 100 GB	<b>B) 5 GB</b><br>The maximum object size for a single PUT operation is 5 GB. For larger objects, you must use multipart upload, which allows objects up to 5 TB.

Which S3 feature allows you to provide temporary access to private S3 objects without requiring AWS credentials?<br>A) S3 Bucket Policies<br>B) S3 Access Control Lists<br>C) S3 Pre-signed URLs<br>D) S3 Transfer Acceleration	<b>C) S3 Pre-signed URLs</b><br>Pre-signed URLs allow temporary access to S3 objects using the credentials of the user who generated the URL, without requiring the recipient to have AWS credentials.

What happens when you enable S3 versioning on a bucket?<br>A) Objects are automatically compressed to save space<br>B) Multiple versions of the same object can be stored, with each version having a unique version ID<br>C) Objects are automatically encrypted<br>D) Objects are replicated to multiple regions	<b>B) Multiple versions of the same object can be stored, with each version having a unique version ID</b><br>S3 versioning allows multiple versions of an object to exist in the same bucket, helping protect against accidental deletion or modification.

Which S3 security feature helps prevent accidental deletion of objects and buckets?<br>A) S3 Encryption<br>B) S3 MFA Delete<br>C) S3 Access Logging<br>D) S3 Transfer Acceleration	<b>B) S3 MFA Delete</b><br>MFA Delete requires multi-factor authentication to permanently delete object versions or change versioning state, providing an additional security layer against accidental or malicious deletions.

What is the primary purpose of S3 lifecycle policies?<br>A) To encrypt objects automatically<br>B) To automatically transition objects between storage classes or delete them based on rules<br>C) To replicate objects to other regions<br>D) To compress objects to reduce storage costs	<b>B) To automatically transition objects between storage classes or delete them based on rules</b><br>S3 lifecycle policies automatically manage objects by transitioning them to cheaper storage classes over time or deleting them when they're no longer needed.

Which S3 access control method provides the most granular permission control and is recommended for most use cases?<br>A) S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs)<br>B) S3 Bucket Policies<br>C) IAM User Policies<br>D) S3 Public Access Settings	<b>B) S3 Bucket Policies</b><br>S3 Bucket Policies provide fine-grained access control using JSON policy language and are recommended over ACLs for most access control scenarios due to their flexibility and powerful condition support.
