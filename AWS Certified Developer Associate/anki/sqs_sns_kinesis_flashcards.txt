What is the main difference between Amazon SQS Standard and FIFO queues?<br>A) Standard queues are faster, FIFO queues are more reliable<br>B) Standard queues offer at-least-once delivery, FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once delivery and message ordering<br>C) Standard queues are cheaper, FIFO queues support larger messages<br>D) Standard queues work globally, FIFO queues work in single regions	<b>B) Standard queues offer at-least-once delivery, FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once delivery and message ordering</b><br>Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery with best-effort ordering, while FIFO queues guarantee exactly-once processing and preserve message order.

What is the purpose of the visibility timeout in Amazon SQS?<br>A) To automatically delete old messages<br>B) To prevent other consumers from processing a message while it's being processed<br>C) To encrypt messages in transit<br>D) To limit the queue size	<b>B) To prevent other consumers from processing a message while it's being processed</b><br>Visibility timeout makes a message invisible to other consumers for a specified duration while one consumer processes it, preventing duplicate processing.

What is the benefit of using SQS Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)?<br>A) To increase message processing speed<br>B) To encrypt sensitive messages<br>C) To capture messages that couldn't be processed successfully after multiple attempts<br>D) To prioritize important messages	<b>C) To capture messages that couldn't be processed successfully after multiple attempts</b><br>Dead Letter Queues capture messages that fail processing after a configured number of retry attempts, allowing for debugging and reprocessing.

What is the main difference between Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose?<br>A) Data Streams is for real-time processing, Firehose is for delivery to data stores<br>B) Data Streams is cheaper, Firehose is more reliable<br>C) Data Streams supports larger data volumes<br>D) Data Streams works with structured data, Firehose with unstructured	<b>A) Data Streams is for real-time processing, Firehose is for delivery to data stores</b><br>Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time data processing with custom applications, while Firehose automatically delivers data to destinations like S3, Redshift, or Elasticsearch.

What is a shard in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?<br>A) A backup copy of stream data<br>B) A unit of capacity that provides 1 MB/sec write and 2 MB/sec read throughput<br>C) An encryption key for the stream<br>D) A filter for incoming data	<b>B) A unit of capacity that provides 1 MB/sec write and 2 MB/sec read throughput</b><br>A shard is the base throughput unit of a Kinesis stream, providing 1 MB/sec or 1,000 records/sec write capacity and 2 MB/sec read capacity.

Which SQS feature helps reduce costs by eliminating empty responses when no messages are available?<br>A) Batch operations<br>B) Long polling<br>C) Message grouping<br>D) Compression	<b>B) Long polling</b><br>Long polling eliminates empty responses by waiting up to 20 seconds for messages to arrive, reducing the number of API calls and associated costs.

What happens when you send a message to an SNS topic that has no subscribers?<br>A) The message is stored until subscribers are added<br>B) The message is discarded<br>C) An error is returned<br>D) The message is sent to a dead letter queue	<b>B) The message is discarded</b><br>If an SNS topic has no subscribers when a message is published, the message is simply discarded. SNS does not store messages for later delivery.

What is the maximum message size for Amazon SQS?<br>A) 64 KB<br>B) 256 KB<br>C) 1 MB<br>D) 10 MB	<b>B) 256 KB</b><br>The maximum message payload size for SQS is 256 KB. For larger payloads, you can use the Extended Client Library to store data in S3 and send a reference.

Which Kinesis service would you use to transform and analyze streaming data in real-time using SQL?<br>A) Kinesis Data Streams<br>B) Kinesis Data Firehose<br>C) Kinesis Data Analytics<br>D) Kinesis Video Streams	<b>C) Kinesis Data Analytics</b><br>Kinesis Data Analytics allows you to process and analyze streaming data in real-time using SQL queries or Apache Flink applications.

What is the purpose of message filtering in Amazon SNS?<br>A) To encrypt messages before delivery<br>B) To allow subscribers to receive only messages that match specific attributes<br>C) To compress large messages<br>D) To prioritize message delivery	<b>B) To allow subscribers to receive only messages that match specific attributes</b><br>SNS message filtering allows subscribers to receive only the messages they're interested in by specifying filter policies based on message attributes.

What is the data retention period for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams by default?<br>A) 1 hour<br>B) 24 hours<br>C) 7 days<br>D) 30 days	<b>B) 24 hours</b><br>Kinesis Data Streams retains data for 24 hours by default, but this can be extended up to 365 days for additional cost.

Which pattern describes using SNS to send a message to multiple SQS queues simultaneously?<br>A) Request-Response Pattern<br>B) Fan-out Pattern<br>C) Load Balancing Pattern<br>D) Circuit Breaker Pattern	<b>B) Fan-out Pattern</b><br>The fan-out pattern uses SNS to distribute a single message to multiple SQS queues (or other endpoints) simultaneously, enabling parallel processing by different components.
