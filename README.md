## Guiding Principles  
- **3 focused bench-hours per workday** (≈ 1.5 h AM + 1.5 h PM) keeps total weekly hours < 45 and avoids burnout.  
- **Pomodoro 25 / 5 cadence** → sustained concentration without fatigue.  
- **Visible progress** → log a short note or screenshot at day's end in this doc.  
- **Spaced repetition, not cramming** → review flash-cards after every module.  
- **Soft stop 4 p.m.** → evenings + weekends are family time.

## Fri May 2  
- [✅] 1. **Read the AWS Developer – Associate Exam Guide** — PDF download.  [oai_citation:0‡Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [✅] 2. **Udemy kick‑off 20 of 490 completed
- [✅] 3. Create a **Gap List** page in this repo noting weak domains.

Notes: IAM-Identity and Access Management is a global service 

Gaps: Since I prevously was taking the course for practitioner, there is overlap, but not the 
depth required for my role. The developer content already feels much more apropriate. 

Projected course days remaining: 24 days. Expecting following days to pick up the pace
since I started the courses mid day.
